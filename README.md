# `Copyright Asset Algorithm on Golem`




-----------------------------------------------
## Problem

Covid pushed the whole world to get digitalised as much as possible in both third world country and developed country. Digitalisation saves time, money and is more efficient. But there are some challenges in digitising the economy. Verifying the identity of digital asset ownership is a big problem. Assets are of many types with different specs. We are tackling the problem with image ownership.

Let's say you are a photographer and clicked the image. You want people to make it viewable, but at the same time, you don't want to let ownership go. For that, you need to have watermark functionality on your image. There are different ways to simulate the watermark but choosing the efficient method is a bit difficult. 

## Solution

Design a new design scheme of copyright management system for digital assets based on digital watermarking. This digital watermark will be hashed and put it on IPFS blockchain.   This digital watermark timestamp authenticate for multiple watermarks (multiple copyrights) to confirm the creation order. The perceptual hash function is used to generate a hash value based on the structure information of images, that watermark information can be confirmed without the original image.  This hash function will be generated on the golem network. 


This scheme can enhance the effectiveness of digital watermarking technology in the field of copyright protection. In this way, use a P2P network to integrate and complete copyright and distribute the copyrighted works without requiring a trusted third party. Nodes rely on cryptography to confirm the identity of each other and ensure the security of information. It can reduce information leakage, data destruction and other risks caused by the collapse of the centralized system in the past. This improves the security and transparency of information and speeds up the distribution of copyrighted works to facilitate circulation in the network. This scheme can also improve copyright protection of multiple creations. Combine Golem blockchain and multiple digital watermarks to record copyright information of every copyright owner in the authoring process and fully prove this information. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Golem Setup 
* IPFS setup
* Some image as digital assets
